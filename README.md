## VBA

This project consists in two main milestones: 
- Refactor the solution from the module to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information 
- Determine whether refactoring the code successfully made the VBA script run faster.

## Python and Pandas

The school board has notified that the database used shows evidence of academic dishonesty. Specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. The school district analysis that was previously done needs to be updated once changes might affect the overall analysis.

## Tableau

Support decision-making processes about a bike-sharing program in Des Moines. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis that:
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week
